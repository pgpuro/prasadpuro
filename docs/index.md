My name is Prasad Puro. I'm a Network Engineer with 15+ years of experience. Most part of my career I worked for major financial banks building and supporting thier complex networks. My technical background includes network design,implementations and operations.

Here I try to write about interesting technical challenges I face in my daily work and I hope you'll find something helpful to take away.
